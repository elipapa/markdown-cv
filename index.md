Firmware Team Leader (3 members) and Firmware Architect for Seed Funded startup based in San Francisco & Belfast. Developed entire firmware for an internet connected, automated brewery. We went from paper-based idea to fully shippable product in 12 months.

Developed entire product firmware in C++ on Particle's IoT Platform (STM32 ARM Cortex M3). The firmware controlled and automated the entire brewing process on the Brewbot machine and interfaced with all on board sensors and actuators (Temperature, Flow, Load Cells). The system also communicated with a Cloud Platform (MQTT) and mobile devices (CoAP).

I also maintained the build system and managed the team's workload, releases and milestones (vaguely SCRUM).
