## Occupation History

### Dyson
`2017-2019`
__Senior Embedded Connectivity Engineer__, Bristol

`2016-2017`
__Advanced Firmware Engineer__, Malmesbury

### Brewbot
`2015-2016`
__Firmware Lead__, Belfast

Firmware Team Leader (3 members) and Firmware Architect for Seed Funded startup based in San Francisco & Belfast. Developed entire firmware for an internet connected, automated brewery. We went from paper-based idea to fully shippable product in 12 months.

Developed entire product firmware in C++ on Particle's WiFi Platform (STM32 ARM Cortex M3). The firmware controlled and automated the entire brewing process on the Brewbot machine and interfaced with all on board sensors and actuators (Temperature, Flow, Load Cells). The system also communicated with a Cloud Platform (MQTT) and mobile devices (CoAP).

I also maintained the build system and managed the team's workload, releases and milestones (vaguely SCRUM).

### Sensata
`2013 - 2014`
__Firmware Engineer__, Belfast

My time at Sensata was spent in their Automotive Innovation Team working on a series of novel Fluid Level Sensing technologies for a new Audi platform. These were developed on 8-bit MCUs and developed in MISRA C. 

During my time at Sensata, I worked with 2 other Engineers to take a product from prototype stage to production floor, implementing all product features (RF based liquid level sensing), a debug interface (1-Wire), an MCU Bootloader & ECU Communications. I also developed testing tools for Windows in C++ Qt to aid in testing and calibration development. 

### NYSE Euronext
`2013 - 2014`
__Platform Software Engineer__, Belfast

As a member of the Platform Team, I focused on development and maintenance of the companies Data Fabric product. Data Fabric is a high performance, low latency, message-oriented middleware platform used to distribute large volumes of application level information. It is a multi-threaded middleware for Linux Systems, written in C, that operates on standardly available IP network hardware. It could leverage Infiniband hardware/networks to implement RDMA, Kernel Bypass solutions. 

My role was to implement robust, production ready C code for regular patches & new features while also managing the Data Fabric Lab and triaging Customer issues. I also developed Python tools to assist support, development and QA.

### Schrader Electronics
`2009 - 2013`
__Embedded Software Engineer__, Belfast

As a member of the "New Products Group" at Schrader, my job was to design, prototype and develop Firmware (in C) for various industrial sensor solutions, all based around an SiLabs 8051 8-bit MCU, often taking concepts from breadboard to production floor. All sensors were bare-metal solutions with a core focus on low-power design on small footprint, <64kB. The sensors communicated with base stations via 433MHz Manchester-Coded RF. As this was a small team, my role had a significant amount of global customer interaction, where I had to distil technical decisions into coherent presentations.
