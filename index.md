## Projects

### *Academic* 

**Emotional Piano Project**

My PhD research in the MAPLE Lab examines the relationship between composers' expressive choices and music's perceived emotion using a combination of formal music analysis, perceptual experiments, and machine learning approaches.

**Auditory Alarms Project**

I have also worked on a project examining how musical considerations in the design of medical auditory alarms can reduce their perceived annoyance, using the tone synthesis software *Supercollider* to generate novel timbres for auditory alarms.

[**Cluster Analysis Explorer**](https://gitlab.com/andersoc/cluster-analysis-preview)

I developed interactive visualization of a cluster analysis of musical data with interactive dendrograms, scatter plots, and audio playback functionality. Written in *Shiny* using *Javascript*. Developed during my graduate residency with the Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship. *Available upon request*.

### *Other Projects*

[**Scale of the Day**](https://gitlab.com/andersoc/practice-scheduler)

A [Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/scaleoftheday) I wrote in *R* to add some variety to my practice routine. Scale of the Day tweets a randomly selected musical scale each day, along with a new jazz tune to learn each week. Tweets posted daily through the Gitlab CI/CD pipeline.
