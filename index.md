I have 11 years of experience as a software developer, designing and implementing solutions on each layer involved by a modern web application.
I support both public administration and private clients implementing the features they require, with a strong focus on code quality and reusability.
I spend a lot of time staying up to date with the lastest programming trends and techniques, I'm curious and always looking for improvement.
I often find myself helping my team mates on the most difficult tasks: being useful is a great source of satisfaction.
I'm a big fan of pair programming because it enables fast knowledge transfer and helps to build better solutions
