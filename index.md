## Projects

### *Academic* 

**<a href="https://maplelab.net/overview/music-and-emotion/" target="_blank"> Emotional Piano Project.</a>**

My PhD research in the MAPLE Lab examines the relationship between composers' expressive choices and music's perceived emotion using a combination of formal music analysis, perceptual experiments, and machine learning approaches.

**<a href="https://maplelab.net/overview/auditory-alarms/" target="_blank"> Auditory Alarms Project.</a>**

I have also worked on a project examining how musical considerations in the design of medical auditory alarms can reduce their perceived annoyance, using the tone synthesis software *Supercollider* to generate novel timbres for auditory alarms.

**<a href="https://cmndrsn.shinyapps.io/clusterappgitlab/" target="_blank">Cluster Analysis Explorer.</a>**

A common issue with musical analyses is the inability to *hear* what an analyst is describing in a musical work. To address this issue, I developed interactive visualization of a cluster analysis of musical data with interactive dendrograms, scatter plots, and audio playback functionality using *Shiny* for *R* and *JavaScript*. I developed the application during my graduate residency with the Lewis & Ruth Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship.
