## Currently

I'm doing my PhD in the History and Philosophy of Science based in UCLouvain, in Belgium. I study the concept of ‘biodiversity’ in non-scientific settings, analysing the diverse meanings and uses that different speakers (politicians, businesses, NGOs, invested scientists) make of it in their particular context. My PhD is part of a larger project that aims at clarifying the <a href="https://blog.pencelab.be/2021/mapping-and-responding-to-taxonomic-disorder/">‘Taxonomic Disorder’</a> in conservation biology.
